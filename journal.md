my thoughts on the new cell phone law are that i kinda like it honestly; i like being able to go outside of the class and see people actaully talking unlike last year. i remember last year during passing period i would take my airpod out and all u could hear was people walking, no talking or anything. this year its verydifferent if u go in the halls u see people smiling and interacting with people. i do think they could let us use our phones during lunch though just because some people dont have friends and dont want friends so they can just go on there phones.
