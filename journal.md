my thoughts on the new cell phone law are that i kinda like it honestly; i like being able to go outside of the class and see people actaully talking unlike last year. i remember last year during passing period i would take my airpod out and all u could hear was people walking, no talking or anything. this year its verydifferent if u go in the halls u see people smiling and interacting with people. i do think they could let us use our phones during lunch though just because some people dont have friends and dont want friends so they can just go on there phones.

i feel like if we had an ai forecast robot i would be able to know the weather any and everywhere. and like think about it the robot wold be able to recognize the patterns of a hurrican or really bad thunderstorm, ect. i think if we had an ai forecast it would be way better because ai is like evrywhere in the world so imagine u being in like californa and knowing the weather in thailand. i just personally think it would be able to recognize weather patterns and analyz data a little better than humans.

i think working in a virtual store for real money is a great opportunity for people to make money at home easy exspecially like young adults and kids that dont have transportation but i think in the long run it would ruin our job market. people would want those jobs more and depending on how easy they are to obtain they could prossibly get them which would make other jobs go more in demand.so yes as it sounds like a great plan in the long run it would actually ruin our job market more.
