my thoughts on the new cell phone law are that i kinda like it honestly; i like being able to go outside of the class and see people actaully talking unlike last year. i remember last year during passing period i would take my airpod out and all u could hear was people walking, no talking or anything. this year its verydifferent if u go in the halls u see people smiling and interacting with people. i do think they could let us use our phones during lunch though just because some people dont have friends and dont want friends so they can just go on there phones.

i feel like if we had an ai forecast robot i would be able to know the weather any and everywhere. and like think about it the robot wold be able to recognize the patterns of a hurrican or really bad thunderstorm, ect. i think if we had an ai forecast it would be way better because ai is like evrywhere in the world so imagine u being in like californa and knowing the weather in thailand. i just personally think it would be able to recognize weather patterns and analyz data a little better than humans.
